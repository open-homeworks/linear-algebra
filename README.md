# LAC

This repository is not intended to be used as a linear algebra library for computation with extensive workloads. Rather, the purpose is to be used as a mean to study linear algebra and the common operations defined in linear algebra. You can think of this repository as a self guided workbook for linear algebra.

This repository can also be seen as a Python workbook, since you would get familiar with building a Python library as you go through. This is the reason to not use Numpy (the most used numeric Python library). If we were to use that library, we would end up calling already made functions and objects instead of building our own. 

## Your Task

What you should do is that you should implement the library. The library consist of the class vector and matrix, its relations and commont operations.


## Contribute

Please do contribute buy providing feedback, reporting issues, commenting or making PRs.

## TODO

- Add graphic representations of the result of operations.


## Getting the answers

I use this workbook as a teaching material at some courses, so the actual implementation is not given by default in the repository. The actual implementation is in the `answers` branch. However, those are encripted, so you won't be able to get the implementation details unless I give you the key. I want to give the key to anyone who thinks they require it, so please email me if you want it. I can respond within one or two weeks, making sure that you have enought time to try to implement it by your self.

## FAQ

1. Why all the trouble with the key?
>I do not really know, I just feel it was the right way to do it.
